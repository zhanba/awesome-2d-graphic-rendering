# Awesome 2d graphics rendering

## 2d graphics library

- [skia](https://skia.org/): Skia is an open source 2D graphics library which provides common APIs that work across a variety of hardware and software platforms. It serves as the graphics engine for Google Chrome and Chrome OS, Android, Flutter, Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS, and many other products.
- [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/): Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

## Vector graphics library

- [piet-gpu](https://github.com/linebender/piet-gpu): An experimental GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.
- [Blend2D](https://blend2d.com/): Blend2D is a high performance 2D vector graphics engine written in C++ and released under the Zlib license.
- [AmanithSVG](https://www.amanithsvg.com/): AmanithSVG is a high performance native software library that implements fast rendering of static SVG files on top of OpenVG API, developed by Mazatech
- [lyon](https://github.com/nical/lyon): 2D graphics rendering on the GPU in rust using path tessellation.
- [pathfinder](https://github.com/servo/pathfinder): A fast, practical GPU rasterizer for fonts and vector graphics.
- [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg): Antialiased 2D vector drawing library on top of OpenGL for UI and visualizations. (not actively maintained)

## Font library

- [harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz): HarfBuzz text shaping engine
- [Allsorts](https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts): Font parser, shaping engine, and subsetter for OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2 implemented in Rust.
- [rustybuzz](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/rustybuzz): A complete harfbuzz's shaping algorithm port to Rust
- [swash](https://github.com/dfrg/swash): Font introspection, complex text shaping and glyph rendering.
- [glyph-brush](https://github.com/alexheretic/glyph-brush): Fast GPU cached text rendering
